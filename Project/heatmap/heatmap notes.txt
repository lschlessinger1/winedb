this will just be a heatmap of the wine locations.
much like lbic, i will use google's API with XML to see where in the world the wines were purchased and made

other ideas:
maybe filter the heatmap by country or something like it
could calculate interesting stuff like where an individual buys the most wines
if an individual has multiple homes, they could track where the specific bottles are in the world
